# Geographical-Data-Analysis-of-Poverty-in-Italy-with-R
This project explores poverty in Italy through a geographical and statistical perspective, using data from ISTAT and BES (Benessere Equo e Sostenibile).   The analysis combines descriptive statistics, spatial autocorrelation tests, and spatial regression models to highlight territorial inequalities and socio-economic drivers of poverty.
